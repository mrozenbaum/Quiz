- The pos variable is used to record what the position the user is at in the test eg. question 3 out of 4.
- The correct variable stores the number of questions answered correctly.
- The test variable contains the ‘test’ div and the test_status variable is used to contain the ‘test_status’ heading which displays the user’s progress in the test.
- The question variable will contain a question grabbed from an array.
- The choice variable will contain the user’s selected answer for a question.
- The choices variable will contain the possible answers that will be displayed to the user.
- chA, chB, and chC variables will contain each possible answer (A, B, or C) in the multiple choice quiz.
